     Another top-level entity used in Transport.mod.  Defined here to allow
     easy updates to the release version of cXML without opening
     Transport.mod.  This should also provide an easy file to search for
     the current release version string.
-->

<!-- cxml.version
    Current default string for the cXML@version attribute.  Corresponds to
    the final directory of the SYSTEM identifier used in all up-to-date
    cXML documents.
    For easy parsing of this file, do not remove whitespace surrounding the
    actual version string.

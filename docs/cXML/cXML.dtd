    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.

    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
